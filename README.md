# Generate a C1,C2,C3 Diagram for the Java AUtomation binding as discussed in class.  
Lecture is availble on Echo 360 that discussed how this should work.
Diagraming tools can be done many ways.  I'd suggest checking out C4-PlantUML or https://structurizr.com/

## Some hints - use the checklist on https://c4model.com/
## Nouns to pay attention to :)
1) Customer Jar file
2) CAD_Application
3) JRE library\install
4) CustomClassLoader.java (I should have really made that a jar file)
5) Java Automation Binding
7) User
## Recall the direction of arrows.  If there is a call and return structure, put that in one direction arrow.  Not two arrows.
## Make sure you can make a phrase from teh diagram.  So  X --- Creates --- > Y   Should be read as X Creates Y.  If it doesn't make sense you need to tinker with labels.


## You can do this with a group, but this is individual submission.

## Don't spend more than 1.5 on making the diagrams.  So approx 30 mins per diagram.  Try to keep less than 4-5 boxes for the focus. That is C1 will have 4-5 boxes.  The C2 will have the 4-5 boxes, and then one of those boxes will be zoomed in and try to limit 4-5 boxes in the zoomed in.  And so on for the C3.

# C1 diagram
I gave hints of the nouns to pay attention to :D.  I think this one could just have 3 boxes (User, CAD_Application, customer JAR file)

# C2 diagram
Zoom in on the CAD_Appliction
For the containers you can use the libraries involved.  

# C3 diagram
Focus on the javaLoader Library

# Submit your three pictures of diagrams to canvas.
