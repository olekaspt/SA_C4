# Generate a C4,C3,C2 Diagram for the Java AUtomation binding as discussed in class.  
Lecture is availble on Echo 360 that discussed how this should work.
Diagraming tools can be done many ways.  I'd suggest checking out C4-PlantUML or https://structurizr.com/

## Some hints - use the checklist on https://c4model.com/
## The context diagram you want to pay attention the nouns :)
1) Customer Jar file
2) CAD_Application
3) JRE
4) CustomClassLoader.java (I should have really made that a jar file)
5) User
## Recall the direction of arrows.  If there is a call and return structure, put that in one direction arrow.  Not two arrows.
## Make sure you can make a phrase from teh diagram.  So  X --- Creates --- > Y   Should be read as X Creates Y.  If it doesn't make sense you need to tinker with labels.


## You can do this with a group, but this is individual submission.

# Submit your three pictures of diagrams to canvas.
